/**
 * Composes `Vault` + `EffectivePageState` into the editor's injected
 * `GetEmbedHeadingSuggestions` boundary — the same pair `resolvePageEmbed.ts`
 * composes, and the same page-lookup logic (literal path, then the sole
 * alias match; an ambiguous or unresolved page yields no suggestions,
 * never a vault-wide fallback). Heading candidates come from
 * `extractHeadingOccurrences` (ADR-032's shared pipeline) against the
 * resolved page's *effective* markdown, so a page open with unsaved
 * heading edits offers up-to-date suggestions, not stale durable ones —
 * consistent with the same live-content principle heading-target embed
 * resolution itself already follows.
 *
 * Matching is case-insensitive substring, mirroring
 * `createWikiLinkSuggester`/`createEmbedSuggester`'s own convention — a
 * deliberately looser rule than `resolvePageEmbed.ts`'s exact-match
 * resolution, the same split already established between "autocomplete
 * suggests broadly" and "resolution matches exactly."
