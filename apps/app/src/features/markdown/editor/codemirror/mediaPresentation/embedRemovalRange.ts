/**
 * Computes the exact `[from, to)` range to delete for "Remove" on an
 * embed occurrence (Image, PDF, or any future embed kind), given the
 * node's own `from` — a real document-text deletion, not a DOM/widget
 * removal (the widget disappears as an ordinary consequence of the
 * owning live-preview extension no longer finding a matching node there
 * on the next decoration rebuild, same as typing over any other
 * construct). This is the one mechanism behind every "Remove" action in
 * the editor — it only ever edits the current note's own Markdown text,
 * never the underlying resource; see `invalidEmbedCard.ts`'s own
 * `onDelete` doc comment and `resourceActionLabels.ts` for the
 * Remove-vs-Archive product rule this enforces.
 *
 * Deleting only the node's own raw text (`![alt](url)`) would leave its
 * now-empty line behind, e.g.
 *
 *   Some text
 *   <blank>
 *   ![Mountain view](https://example.com/mountain.jpg)
 *   <blank>
 *   More text
 *
 * → (naive) →
 *
 *   Some text
 *   <blank>
 *   <blank>
 *   More text
 *
 * — an extra blank line, not the single-blank-line paragraph gap plain
 * Markdown expects between two paragraphs. Three cases, in order:
 *
 * 1. **The embed is the document's only line** — delete everything.
 * 2. **The embed is the document's first or last line** — trim every
 *    consecutive blank line on the *interior* side (the only side that can
 *    have a real paragraph to reconnect to) down to nothing, plus the one
 *    separator newline joining that run to whatever real content precedes/
 *    follows it. Deleting the very first or very last paragraph of a
 *    document must never leave a dangling leading/trailing blank line —
 *    there is no "single blank-line gap between two paragraphs" to
 *    preserve at a document edge, since there is only one paragraph there,
 *    not two.
 * 3. **The embed sits between two other lines** — consume the embed's own
 *    line plus **one** adjacent blank line (preferring the line before,
 *    falling back to the line after): this is what collapses a
 *    blank-line-delimited paragraph pair back down to a single gap,
 *    reproducing the worked example's exact expected output. Neither
 *    neighbor blank (embed directly adjacent to real content on both
 *    sides) falls back to deleting just its own line.
 *
 * A pure function over `EditorState`/positions — no `EditorView`, no
 * dispatch — so it's directly testable and directly usable as a
 * `changes` spec by any caller (`ImageWidget.ts`'s and
 * `PdfEmbedWidget.ts`'s own "Remove" controls, plus every broken-embed
 * card's "Remove" button via `invalidEmbedCard.ts`). Takes only the
 * node's `from` (never `to`): the line-break guard already shared by
 * `imageLivePreview.ts`/`embedLivePreview.ts`/`wikiLinkLivePreview.ts`
 * guarantees an embed node never crosses a line, so `from` alone is
 * enough to identify its one and only line.
